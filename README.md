# Analysis and Development Project - Group 12
## AdriaLinkX
Our Proof of Concept implements graphs, maps, along with a History API and a Push Notifications system.
Using our API as a customer, one can get the needed reservation information, reservation history, shuttle locations, and disturbances/problems.
Sysadmins can also access all the things customers have access to, with the addition of the complete history of all reservations and all shuttle locations.
